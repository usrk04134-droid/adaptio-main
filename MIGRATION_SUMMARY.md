# BigSnake::Parse() Test Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated and enhanced the image processing tests from the old adaptio-core repository into the adaptio repository. The tests now focus on unit testing the `BigSnake::Parse()` function directly using the doctest framework.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Test Files Created

#### Core Test Files
- **`src/scanner/joint_model/test/big_snake_test.cc`**
  - Comprehensive unit tests for BigSnake::Parse()
  - Tests various scenarios: normal processing, median profiles, updated properties, approximation mode, horizontal hints
  - Performance benchmarking included
  - Uses hardcoded test data for reliability

- **`src/scanner/joint_model/test/big_snake_yaml_test.cc`**
  - YAML-driven test suite for flexibility
  - Reads test configurations from external YAML file
  - Supports batch processing of all test images
  - Easy to extend with new test cases

### 2. Test Data Infrastructure

- **`src/scanner/joint_model/test/test_data/data_set.yaml`**
  - Central configuration for test cases
  - Contains expected ABW points for each test image
  - Defines joint properties and scanner configurations
  - Specifies tolerance values for comparison

### 3. Supporting Tools

- **`src/scanner/joint_model/test/run_big_snake_tests.sh`**
  - Bash script to build and run tests
  - Supports both Nix and CMake build systems
  - Filters to run only BigSnake-related tests

- **`src/scanner/joint_model/test/annotate_test_image.py`**
  - Python tool for annotating new test images
  - Interactive GUI for marking ABW points
  - Exports annotations in YAML format
  - Helps create new test cases easily

- **`src/scanner/joint_model/test/README.md`**
  - Comprehensive documentation
  - Explains test structure and ABW points
  - Instructions for running tests
  - Guide for adding new test cases

### 4. CMake Integration
- Updated `src/scanner/joint_model/test/CMakeLists.txt` to include new test files
- Tests are compiled as part of the `adaptio-unit-tests` executable

## Key Features

### Test Coverage
✅ **Multiple Image Types**
- Normal V-joint with clear laser line
- Dark/black images (failure cases)
- Support for adding more image types

✅ **Comprehensive Scenarios**
- Basic parsing functionality
- Processing with median profiles
- Updated joint properties
- Approximation mode
- Horizontal hints
- Performance benchmarking

✅ **Flexible Test Data**
- YAML-based configuration
- Easy to add new test cases without code changes
- Annotated expected ABW points with tolerances

### ABW Points Tested
The tests verify all 15 ABW points:
- ABW0-ABW8: Active welding profile points
- ABW9-ABW14: Reserved for future use

### Comparison with Original Tests
| Aspect | Original (adaptio-core) | New (adaptio) |
|--------|-------------------------|---------------|
| Test Type | Integration tests | Unit tests |
| Framework | Custom test runner | doctest |
| Focus | Full image processing pipeline | BigSnake::Parse() function |
| Configuration | Hardcoded | YAML-based + hardcoded |
| Extensibility | Required code changes | YAML configuration |
| Documentation | Limited | Comprehensive |

## How to Use

### Running Tests
```bash
# Using the provided script
./src/scanner/joint_model/test/run_big_snake_tests.sh

# Using Nix
nix build .#adaptio-unit-tests
./result/bin/adaptio-unit-tests --test-case="*BigSnake*"

# Using CMake directly
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
make adaptio-unit-tests
./src/adaptio-unit-tests --test-case="*BigSnake*"
```

### Adding New Test Images
1. Place the TIFF image in `src/scanner/joint_model/test/test_data/`
2. Use the annotation tool to mark ABW points:
   ```bash
   python3 src/scanner/joint_model/test/annotate_test_image.py path/to/image.tiff
   ```
3. Add the generated YAML to `data_set.yaml`
4. Run tests to verify

### Viewing Test Results
Tests provide detailed output including:
- Pass/fail status for each test case
- ABW point comparisons with actual vs expected values
- Processing time measurements
- Error codes for failure cases

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of test code, test data, and configuration
2. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new test cases via YAML without touching code
3. **Debugging**: Detailed error messages and point-by-point comparisons
4. **Performance**: Includes benchmarking to track processing speed
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and inline comments
6. **Tooling**: Annotation tool for creating new test cases

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- [ ] Automated test image generation
- [ ] Visual diff tools for failed tests
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Coverage reporting for BigSnake code
- [ ] More diverse test images (different joint types, lighting conditions)
- [ ] Regression test suite for specific bug fixes

## Files Modified/Created

### Created Files
- `src/scanner/joint_model/test/big_snake_test.cc`
- `src/scanner/joint_model/test/big_snake_yaml_test.cc`
- `src/scanner/joint_model/test/test_data/data_set.yaml`
- `src/scanner/joint_model/test/run_big_snake_tests.sh`
- `src/scanner/joint_model/test/annotate_test_image.py`
- `src/scanner/joint_model/test/README.md`
- `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

### Modified Files
- `src/scanner/joint_model/test/CMakeLists.txt` (added new test files)

## Conclusion

The migration successfully brings the image processing tests from adaptio-core into the adaptio repository with significant improvements:
- Tests are now proper unit tests focusing on the `BigSnake::Parse()` function
- YAML-based configuration makes it easy to add new test cases
- Comprehensive documentation ensures maintainability
- Supporting tools facilitate test case creation and execution

The implementation follows the skeleton approach mentioned in the merge request while expanding it to handle multiple images and provide comprehensive test coverage.
